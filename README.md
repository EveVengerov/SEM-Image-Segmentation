# SEM-Image-Segmentation
This project will introduce some basic image segmentation techniques driven by 
unsupervised machine learning techniques such as the Gaussian mixture model, k-means 
clustering, and template matching, and use them to segment a scanning electron microscopy 
image of graphene on a substrate. This paper gives brief overview of graphene, SEM images, 
Machine Learning, Neural Networks, introduces U-Net, a popular convolutional neural 
network commonly developed for image segmentation in biomedicine
